Prime Generator (v1.0)
=============================

This is a program for generating prime numbers! Exciting! It's algorithm relies on the idea that all composite numbers are the products of various prime numbers. Thus, if you divide a number by all the prime numbers less than it, and none are factors, it too must be prime. The implementation currently relies on an ArrayList<Integer> that is populated as the program runs. It is very inefficient, but it works. It currently does not accept user input, so test cases must be defined in the main method. Later versions will correct this.

Tested up to 12887773. Reason test ended: got bored of waiting for my computer to run out of memory, and the calculation had slowed down considerably.
